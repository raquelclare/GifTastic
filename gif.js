// Creat an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests me
var topics = [];

// Take the topics in this array and create buttons in my HTML
// Use a loop that appends a button for each string in the array into 
// the dynamic buttons div

//When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, 
// non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them in the gifs div

// UNDER every gif, display its rating--- what if I only want G and PG rated gifs
// This data is provided by the GIPHY API

//===== Do the above before moving on =====

// Add a form to your page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it 
// to your topics array

// Lastly, make a function call that takes each topic in the array that remakes the
// buttons on the page
